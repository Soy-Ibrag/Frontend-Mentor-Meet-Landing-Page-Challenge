# Meet Landing Page

## 📄 Project Overview

This is a solution to the [Meet Landing Page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/meet-landing-page-rbTDS6OUR) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a responsive landing page for a fictional event, focusing on clean design and a smooth user experience. This project allowed me to practice working with responsive layouts and refining my design-to-code process.
